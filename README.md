# Go-Up

**Note**: _THIS IS NOT A GO VERSION MANAGER. The Purpose of this programm is to check if new version of go is available for update. If available you can just updgrade to newer version without mannually downloading them and without any hassle._

## Prerequisite
Make sure `go` is installed and run `go run main.go --doctor` to make sure if all the necessary dependencies are installed.

That's it!

Run `go run main.go --check` to check if new version is available.

And running `go run main.go` will automatically check for update and update to newer version if available.
